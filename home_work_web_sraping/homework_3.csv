                3D Printed Exoskeleton Hands
                			",Alexander Czech,New Exoskeleton Arms >>> https://sellfy.com/p/Zr0t/Updated - (9th July 2015) - New predrilled holes for models3D printed exoskeleton hands that I made for a bit of fun. If you want to watch a video of it in use https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7T-S3UFR-0. For the latest 3D printed exoskeleton updates visit https://sellfy.com/3DPrintIt. My website is http://3dprintit.com.au/.DESCRIPTIONPLEASE READ THE MANUAL BEFORE PRINTINGThe manual is in the .zip file. I designed the hand using ABS plastic the more infill the stronger the hand but the longer the print time. The entire hand will take approximately 18 hours in total and cost about $8.00 in plastic (at 4 cents a gram). All parts were printed on my Up Plus 2 with 14cm x 15cm x 15cm build volume. There are also a lot of metal screws that you need to hold all of the printed parts together. I used sheet metal self tapper pan screws 8G x 9mm.***Disclaimer – 3D Print It will not be liable for personal injury resulting from negligent use of this product.

The narrator, an air pilot, tells how, having made a forced landing in the Sahara desert, he meets the Little Prince. The wise and enchanting storeies the prince tells about the planet where he lives with three volcanoes and a haughty flower, about other planets and their rulers, and about his fight with the bad seeds, make him an entrancing, unforgettable charecter.' - Backpage blub from The Little Prince, by Antoine De Saint-Exupery. Check out more in the series. The initial concept behind transforming the illustations from 2D to 3D is to create resources to improve the experience of literature for the blind and partially sighted through rendering illustrations and graphics from well-known fiction into tactile objects and reliefs.

                The Thork
                			",Trevor Day - Enterprise XD Design,"I'm just going to take a quick break from the endless barrage of coasters (well I like them...) to upload my latest invention; The Thork.  Basically I got sick of getting cheesy gunge all over my fingers whenever I ate Wotsits and, like so many instances these days, I turned to 3D printing as a solution.  It's a thimble with an added fork blade and is the perfect solution for fast-food outings, Netflix boxset grazing and just generally any time you want to eat finger food but want to keep your fingers clean.The Thork is easy enough to print and assemble but I strongly have to suggest printing it (if possible) in a antibacterial filament or just making sure it's washed thoroughly every time you use it.  I won't take responsibility if you don't...The Thork is also available, printed and assembled and also with an optional sachet of Sugru mouldable infill (for those who don't have my fat fingers) from my Etsy store - www.etsy.com/uk/shop/enterprisexddesign"

In this new model, you can choose how to join fingers, using screws (2M), axes wire, or filament printer.The fingers flex when they are pulled by strings, such as fishing line, and extend automatically with the help of elastic cord.A fabric strap with velcro is needed to secure the prosthesis to the arm.

This has been reached through 3d printed objects that let them draw and write easily and freely. The project has been realized for TOG foundation (Milan), which takes care of these kids, in collaboration with the italian fablab Opendot (Milan). Many children suffer from pathologies which compromise their ability to draw and write. This is due to hand shapes and postures that make almost impossible this apparently simple gesture.Usually happens that these children are not able to open their hands because these are completely tighten or warped. That's why the only way to design was using back-hand and fingers as refernces.Our main goals were to make this object EASY TO REPLICATE, EASY TO CLEAN and EASY TO CARRY but also COMFORTABLE and CUSTOMIZABLE. Making it colorful and appealing for kids was not less important at all.The design comes from the necessity to make the pen always point on the paper, working alongside the hand movements. The largest pen/pencil it can fit is 10mm in diameter and the handle variations are theorically endless. credits:designed by Elisa Castelletta / Giovanni Dipilato / Sara Monacchi / Andrea Pelino / Luca Toscanoin collaboration with TOG Fundation (http://togethertogo.org) and Opendot (http://www.opendotlab.it)"

                			",Andres Canan,"Hello everyone!This is my entry for the ""Make Anything Design Challenge: PUZZLES""The 15-puzzle (also called Gem Puzzle, Boss Puzzle, Game of Fifteen, Mystic Square and many others) is a sliding puzzle that consists of a frame of numbered square tiles in random order with one tile missing.The object of the puzzle is to place the tiles in order by making sliding moves that use the empty space.Since the first moment I'd started to think in this challenge my idea was to do something else than a simple puzzle, infact this is a very simple puzzle, but that's why I made a Braille version of this game for reduced vision or blind people.The second idea was to design a piece that is PIP (Print In Place) and P&P (Print and Play), that's why the numbers are disordered except for the Braille version which is ordered (from 1 to 15) for a better initial recognition.I would be very very happy if you know someone with this condition who you can print this puzzle.I hope you can print it and have fun with it.Happy Printing!"

                Peter Krige - water cap and flex tap
                			",Peter,Design by Peter Kirge - A hose or plastic tube is attached to the inner nozzle on the Water Cap. This is then inserted into the water container. The cap is screwed on and the inner rubber washer ensures an air tight seal. The water container is half filled with water.Then a longer piece of hose or plastic tube is attached to the outer nozzle and its other end installed in the flex tap. The flex tap works by creating a kink in the tube which controls or stops the water flow depending on how much the user flexes the handle.A bicycle pump is connected to the schrader valve and the container pressurised with air.ADD YOUR COMMENTS BELOW!

                Hand
                			",BQ 3D,"This prosthesis has been designed to help those people with missing fingers.It has been modelled keeping in mind the following principles:-Keep the number of printed parts as low as possible-Keep the assembly process as simple as possible-Use the least possible amount of non-printable parts. The bolts and nuts in the joints have been replaced by bits of 1.75mm filament.-Leave openings in the model to allow the hand to transpire-Allow a higher degree of freedom in the wristThe fingers flex when they are pulled by strings, such as fishing line, and extend automatically with the help of elastic cord.A fabric strap with velcro is needed to secure the prosthesis to the arm.The model is open-source, and thus can be studied and modified to improve its performance.https://youtu.be/0TF3ih02L9AAuthor: http://www.soniaverdu.es/Print SettingsRafts: Doesn't MatterSupports: Doesn't MatterResolution: 0.2 mmInfill: 10% Notes:For greater resistance: Shell thinkness(mm) 1.2Post-PrintingYou can use tape boxer, it is cotton.

                Pencil Holder 50mm
                			",Hugh Cowart,"This is a remix of my Pencil holder which was 100mm tall. It used up a lot of filament even with no infil but it was very flimsy. This one I setup to use about the same amount of filament but was half the hight. The hinge lets you quickly re-arrange or split up your tools of choice for your art projects. Also, at 50mm high it works great for crayons. The 100mm version will swallow them, and any well used (loved) pencils as well. If you want one printed for you, head on over to our Etsy Shop . However I will warn you... the amount of material and time makes this one a bit more expensive than you would think. Still cheaper than shapeways, and most printing services I have seen. I am still working on version that use less material. "

                Prosthetic Hand Concept
                			",Jonathan Holman,"This object was entered in the MakeShaper Design Challenge (see all entries here).This model is an interesting test of the concept of Interface Bonds. As TPU has some difficulty adhering to PETG and ABS when printed directly onto a face, a better, and more durable mode of adhesion for heavy use applications is needed. Interface bonds are when a material is bonded to another with the use of internal geometry. The flexible sections have links inside the fingers to prevent them from becoming loose, and it is a very strong connection.This concept of Interface Bonds has quite a few applications, and prosthetic limbs are one of them. More realistic movements, lower cost and easier customization to each patient can be acheved with the use of a rigid material combined with a flexible material.This model has internal geometry to be able to run fising line through, to act as tendons. The recommended material for the joints is TPU 85A. 95A might be too stiff, and I have not tested with 60A.I scaled the print up by a factor of 1.2, or 120% for the test model. Depending on what diameter of the fishing line you get for the tendons, printing even larger might be required."

It has been designed to angle the cards backwards, but not too far so others cannot see them, as well as being curved so it will hold one card in place as well as a full hand of up to 13 cards.To use just sort and fan your cards as usual and slot them into the holder... then draw them out as/when required.You don't need to hold your cards up at all as the curvature and angle do it all for you... plus, there is a small bridge at each end so the cards won't slide out the side. Once placed in correctly, and as long as care is taken when drawing out cards to play, your cards will stay secure for the duration of the game.If you like this take time to check out my other designs!"

I chose to design and print an aid for helping people with arthritis use scissors. I printed the base at low infill to reduce material costs, the rest of the parts need to be strong, and require a higher infill. I also printed at the highest layer height I could for my printer to reduce print times. It requires the following parts: 4X M3x10mm bolt 4X M3 Heat Set Insert2X Zipties1X Pair of Scissors 4X Printed PartsTotal Cost: ~$9.00 USDCost of Actual Device: $31.95 USD Link: https://www.arthritissupplies.com/mounted-table-top-scissors.html To assemble, first ziptie scissors to base using two zipties, one on either side. Then place the scissor clamp onto the base using the m3 heat set inserts into the printed part, and m3x10mm screws. Finally assemble the top and bottom of the push handle using 2 more m3 heat inserts and m3x10mm screws. Future improvements:Use spring loaded scissors to improve usability, or figure out how to use springs or rubber bands to work with any scissors. Use magnets, double sided tape, or weights to help hold the entire assembly down to the table."

                Wheelchair for people in 3rd world countries ""HU-GO""
                			",Hugo-archicad,"  Its a wheelchair for people that need one!I call it 'HU-GO'I am adding more parts daily.I have modelled most of it now.I have just started 3D printing the first bits.update 1: I have finished printing all the parts now (25th oct 2015 and the cutting of the MDF started today ( my jigsaw ability leaves a lot to be desired)update 2: I am printing one small wheel and if I have time I will print the other (28th oct 2015).update 3: arm for chair has been modified (the new one uses less material and quicker to print) I will leave the other file in case someone wants that one instead.update 4: I have almost finished (31st oct 2015), I learned how to do sewing today. So I did the cushions and the armrests.update 5: what next now that it is finished ?(Sunday 1st Nov 2015 Australia)update 6: Its fits in the back of my little car (so if it fits in a MINI then it fits in most cars(photo added to gallery)update 7: We have a very short youtube video here of the 3D printed wheelchair in action (dont mind my friends at work who are a little shy):http://youtu.be/9n2WbFhp-DUupdate 8: I am adding the sizes of nuts and washers I used for every connection(see photo added below). (the holes are bigger and could take a large bolt if you need to secure it more, but from my experience they are strong enoughupdate 9: I have added more photos with a wide angle lens and much closer shots.update 10: Today I got a response from the Mens shed (a government organisation that helps men suffering depression and helps them with projects and company).update 11: I was contacted by a Sydney based Australian organisation today who have offered a lending hand.I have emailed Ikea foundation http://www.ikeafoundation.org/ to see if they would like to help me. We wait and seeDear HugoThank you very much for your interest in responding to the Village News article on Spring Hill Men's Shed. I am certain that your expertise in 3D printing would of worthwhile appeal to shed members.At this stage, however, we are not yet operating as a men's shed, but are still in the process of forming an incorporated organisation for the management of our shed. We do, at least have a venue for the shed, in the undercroft of the Bedford Park Community Hall in Love Street Spring Hill. I have noted your willingness to become involved, and will contact you again when we are about to have our next meeting.regardsRob Collinson behalf of the Men's Shed Spring Hill Management Committee.update 11: I have the sketches for the big wheel which i know know i can 3D print also.i am adding those sketches now!!UPDATE 12: THIS DESIGN HAS BEEN SHORTLISED FOR ANOTHER COMPETITION ORGANISED BY THESE GUYS (I THINK IS THE INTERNATIONAL COMITTEE OF THE RED CROSS)(12-15 TEAMS ONLY, I AM A TEAM OF ONE!)http://www.enablemakeathon.org/Start by share it wherever you can and start printing it worldwide!!!Why not make it a school project.some kids can sew the seat covers, others in wood class can make the frame and others can 3D print the parts, the seniors could design it better! go on its for a great cause.I have contacted one school already near me to see if they would like to get a talk on 3D printing and its benefits from me free of charge (waiting for the school principal to call me back) then good things could start.....I hope I can make the deadline. (update....I made the deadline and we now have a fully made functional wheelchair anyone can put together)I decided to create this wheelchair because I have used one before due to my own illness,I was a Sydney 2000 Olympic volunteer and part of my job then was to help people that are a different kind of perfect move around the Olympic park.we even received training how to operate a wheelchair during the induction.I have been 3D printing many things and for many people over the last 3 years and I think is time I begin to design/make something for a noble cause.So, I thought I should pay it forward and create one that anyone in the world could make and assemble with a very common cheap parts.I visited my country of Birth Chile a few months ago and I saw first hand how 3D printed parts for different kind of perfect people could transform their lives but sadly they didnt know where to go to get their needs met or that it could be very cheap. I strongly Believe that everyone in the world deserves to be able to move about and a wheelchair should not be a luxury item for the few/well off. It should be a tool that anyone should have access to use.So, I am accepting this challenge with the 'hugo' version 1.0Version 2.0 will have 3D printed wheels/ and or hubs also but due to the deadline I will leave it for later.I only found this competition yesterday (19th of October 2015) so I am busily trying to get it all done in time.Wish me luck! I am spending all of my spare time with this project.This is a lovely thing a friend does for a mate but it should not have to be this hard!!http://laughingsquid.com/chinese-student-piggybacks-his-disabled-friend-to-class-for-three-years-so-he-wouldnt-miss-out-on-his-education/So, I am attempting version 1.Version 2 will have 3D printed wheels/ and or hubs also but due to the deadline I will leave it for later.I only found this competition yesterday so I am busily trying to get it all done.The material list will be like this: (will be adding more as I need it)-Plywood/MDF 16mm thick-roll of plastic (1 kilo exactly is what will be needed to print all the components!!)at the end I will rename each part so it has its weight in grams in case you are wondering if you have enough.-zip ties (to support not load bearing components instead of using nuts, bolts and washers which are heavier and more expensive ( I used these for the seat support beam ends)-rods 'broom sticks' of two sizes (50mm for cross bracing and 20mm for the others)-nuts and bolts (will specify how many, what type, size, lenght,etc)-paint (because the frame is kind of chunky a nice vibrant happy colour would be great (I will do version 1 in red because it will go faster)-2 old/new long 'socks' for the arm rests•               fabric for the seats (I was thinking flour bags) and or old tshitstools required-Jigsaw-drill (hand held or electric)-screwdriver-spanner (will specify size)-access to a 3D printer-access to needle and thread-pair of scissorsand a bit of room to make it. (I live in a small apartment so my workshop was my balcony which I had to leave everytime my little dog needed to go to the toilet, he is shy and doesn't like to go when there are people watching), so a little more room would be best and a bench/table would be great to have too.finally, I dont like the term disabled so instead I replace it with ""a different kind of perfect"" which I got from here (its far nicer)http://themighty.com/2015/04/the-term-that-describes-my-daughter-better-than-special-needs-or-disabled/note: I have started to put PDF's now.once I do the frame today, I will make a cad file of it in PDF and DWG and STL in one piece so that maybe someone with a laser cutter machine big enough can cut it automatically.also when the frame is done i will assemble it and begin to take photos of the real thing!!!!This project has taken a great amount of time, effort and resources to design and build.(As you know any prototype is expensive at first, I am happy to wear the costs)My purpose is to share it with the world for free, however a small contribution would be a huge help to continue its development.please go here and help me if you believe in this worthy cause.https://www.paypal.me/justonedollarMy dream would be for this project to be copied by someone like IKEA and mass produce this flat packed and shipped wherever these might be needed as part of help that countries offer one another.Anyone with questions or help, done hesitate to send me a message and I will endeavour to reply ASAP.Print SettingsRafts: Doesn't MatterSupports: Doesn't MatterResolution: I have printed all my parts so far at 0.2mm resInfill: see notes belowNotes: Print it at a good resolution so it has all the strength it needsmy 3D printer software does not allow me to change the infill so I cannot help you.I wish it did!!!!my 3D printer software does not allow me to change the infill, like honeycomb etc.so most parts are chunkier that I think they ought to be.I see now the cross brace could be resized to the normal broom thickness instead of the 40mm which I used)All parts are laid flat so they are easy to print.How I Designed Thiswheelchair- the 'HU-GO'I started by looking at my own wheelchair and how the loads where distributed.I think that formed the design more than anything.then i began to sketch what this might look like and how many bits i would need to make.then I began to redesign the parts so it would use the minimal amount of filament and or parts.I also began to think how i could use normal everyday things for a useful purpose for this project in particular.Like the idea of re using socks for the arm rests and flour bags for the seat materials.On my next version I will be designing hubs out of filament so I can use wooden wheels cut out of plywood.I have the design ready but not the time for this competition. ( update! I have designed and now 3D printed and installed the front wheels)I have added my wheel design to the list of parts to download (small wheels) with tread and sacrificial bushes and also washers.   I am now attaching the big wheel design below now!!!!! thats the final piece of the puzzle!!!this is the frame made out of MDF or plywood and the cross bracingI used these to hold on to the two timber framesthis is my cross frame supportthis is the other cross brace support ( I had to make two types, one for the top and one for the bottom)its workingthese are the cross bracing supportsmy jigsaw skills are improving see how the curve to the frame matches (more or less) the support with the same radiithis is my mock up design for the seat fabric support, this was the hardest thing to solve.and this is the actual component that hold the (pencils) see image abovethis is my check print to make sure it worked before sending the wheel to the printer because I had limited blue material. I made a sacrificial bush out of plastic to go inside the wheel and two washers out of pla alsoand this is the wheel fitted and working wellthats me sewing for the first time!! My mother in law was giving me tips over the phone this is my sewing handiwork!! it turned out well. although I still do not know how to close the ends. I did the sewing then turned it inside out and folded the end inwards.this photo shows the frames being cut with a jigsaw , look at my supporting table 'its 3D printed!!!'this is the table I 3D printed last year from thingiverse and the thing that got me thinking about a wheelchair joined/constructed by broomsticks using the same principle.it fits in the back of my MINI so it fits in most cars!! unless you have a smart fortwo..or maybe it does fit there too?!these are the nut and washers I used for all the connections in this projectclose up shotsee cross bracing under seatpush bar/top cross bracebottom brace and wheel assembly3D printed wheel with tread! and you can also see the washers but not the bush inside which is to be replaced every so often depending on use, thus making the wheel last longer. (sacrificial bush)bottom bracebig wheel designthis is how the big wheel would work, basically a copper pipe is filled with sand so its easy to bend and prevents cracking of the pipe, this is the tire! then the tube is blued or screwed to the 3D printed segments that connect the wheel to the hub via broom sticks ( a bit like everything else in this wheelchair design)this is the hub drawing. it will have 'tentacles' where the broom sticks connect to.this would be the hub with the tentacles and the way it would all connectas you can see i cannot draw circles very well BUT the idea is sound. hub with tentacles connecting to segments which are joined by the sand filled copper pipe."

And the finger-shape can be stuck onto that using the appropriate angled block.You can print rings and holders at different scales until you find the correct size for the hands/fingers you are working with.So pick the parts, find the right scale for your application, and you can construct many different combinations of utilities.We have had success with finger-stilts, and with a knife-mount for cutting, and general waterbottle handle. These are all modular parts-based so you can scale and print just the appropirate bits and then stick them together. We usually use prestik first... and then once we think it can work we stick it down with proper glue.The platform can be used with velcro-straps to attache around the palm of the hand.I will add to the kit as we go.

                Yogurt or compote pot holder and grips. Adaptative and ergonomic devices
                			",MoreAnge,"This is only my second entrance on a 3D design contest. I'm happy participating with « MyMiniFactory + Barclays Eagle Labs » by contribuating for this #enabledby3d program !!!I'm particulary sensitive to handicap's situations, because I know people in my immediate and extended family who live this kind of situation. One of the main interests of the 3D printing is the customization for each object who will be manufactured. And that perfectly matches the field of disability, as it must constantly offer a unique solution to each patient, because he lives daily with its own unique situation and very personal. The world of 3D printing can make a great revolution and become a valuable aid for people with limited use of their hands (and also other handicaps, but the subject currently involves hands). It will be possible to adapt with a great precision the necessary devices for each particular case. We will help to better people who deserve better living conditions, and this contribute to a better well-being for them.So, I've designed a modular device, who allows holding a compote or yoghurt pot, correctly. You just have to print the ""Yogurt Holder.stl"" first, and searching the best solution for the handle by testing one or more of the other objects designed for my project. You can go from a handful to another as many times as you want, thanks to the system of interlocking dovetail that engages from underneath the device.*** You could merge the .stl files when you will have find the best solution with meshlab or meshmixer, and finaly have only one mechanical part by prinitng your design. You can use the ""Dovetail Shape for mesh mixing.stl"" file for adapting an other handle solution. Be attentive of the orientation of this mesh, there are 91 degree angles between the bottom and the two faces who will be engaged on the negative dovetail shape from ""Yogourt Holder.stl"". If you are not vigilant, your mechanical part won't slide correctly. It 'll be possible, but you 'll have to put your part upside own !!! ***I wanted to design a nice object, which don't remember a medicinal device. In the specifications that I had imagined, I had decided that it had to be easy to print.If you have suggestions or questions you can use the « MyminiFactory » website comment section. For a specifical adaptation of the handle, you can use the same way, I'll study a few case for helping you (I'd need to collect a maximum of informations (description, photos, vidéos, measuring datas).Printing Tips :PLA : all the object of this project have been optimized for PLA, there is 0,2mm tolerance for a good slide between mechanical parts. Optimized results with the technical spécifications below (after ABS paragraph). These choices were made based on existing and current technical specificities of FDM printing machines.ABS : you will have to verify if the tolerance are good or not (test only the 20 first layers. If necessary, adjust a little by scaling ""yogurt holder"" (1.01 until 1.03).Put vertically the object, like the .stl file on nettfab for example. (except ""Long Handle for Yogurt Holder.stl"" : you must have to rotate it for 180 degrees on x axis. It will be upside down).0,4 mm nozzle.20% or 33% Infill.Brim, no raft needed.No support material (except ""Single 45deg rotation Left Handle for Yogurt Holder.stl"" and ""Single 45deg rotation Right Handle for Yogurt Holder.stl"".), the objects are designed with the 45 degrees rule.Wall thickness : 0,8mm0,2mm for layers thickness.#enabledby3d Wholeheartedly for a better World. #enabledby3dMy49RobotAnge3000"

                Hairspray Pump
                			",Henry Qiu,"Please read the safety concern section belowMost of you have glass beds, and hairspray is one of the most commonly used bed adherence tools.I'm not a fan of removing my glass bed every time I re-apply hairspray so I usually fold a paper towel into a little square, and spray the hairspray onto there, and then wipe it on in a thin layer in the middle of the bed. This has worked great, except I need two hands to do this, and I always end up coating the other hand in hairspray.I was modeled after a can of unscented extra super hold Aquanet, but this has fit with a wide range of compression cans.NOTEIf It doesn't mist out and it ends up streaming out, (the hole may seal due to over extrusion), just take a thin needle or pin and tap it into the hole. I used a 0.5mm needle to enlarge my hole, mists perfectly now1) Print this out2) Pull off the spray nozzle on your bottle of hairspray3) Snap this into place4) ...5) You're done!Now, I have a little sheet of paper towel folded next to the can, and every time I want to apply some hairspray to the bed single handedly, I just take the paper towel, and press down on the mouth quickly, and wipe that on the bed. Nice single even coating of hairspray!I used concentric supports at 30% with a 0.5mm gap, it supported it great and fits perfectlAfter the unfortunate events that took place regarding the hairspray ignition, I hope that this becomes more aware to more people to be more cautious while doing anything similar; not only with hairspray, but with anything flammable. This means to remember to put the lid back on your Acetone, Rubbing Alcohol, anything that can be a risk to your safety. Don't take shortcuts, take the time to remove your glass bed and apply the hairspray in a well ventilated area away from any ignition sources.Please note that I am NOT trying to promote my design, but offering it as a solution to those who don't want to remove the bed every timeI designed this model a while back for applying hairspray onto a glass bed. It goes over the top of a standard aerosol spray can nozzle and acts as a pressure pump, where you press down onto the opening with a paper towel or rag, and sprays onto there. From there, I give the bed two or three thin even coatings, without having to remove the glass bed or getting any excess mist into any hazardous areas. If you know you aren't going to remember to take the precaution to remove the glass bed before applying, this is one workaround you can use. Again, I appreciate the generous tipping on thingiverse, but I offer this as a free model and please, take the necessary precautions for your own safety. And to the family who had to go through this, we send the best wishes your direction, words fall short of expressing our sorrow for your loss.InstallationWhen installing, remove the spray nozzle on your aerosol spray can and carefully put this on. When I first put it on, I thought it was a good idea to just press this onto it, and resulted in hairspray in my face. This has happened to others as well, and there are two solutions that I have heard.1) position it on top of the nozzle and with one palm, slam downwards onto the opening directly quickly. This will snap it into place before it sprays everywhere2) use needle nose pliers and grip the opening of the nozzle to avoid it being compressed inwards, and snap this into place."

                Umbrella holder for wheelchair - version2
                			",CARLOS BASAURI,"Umbrella holder for wheelchairCompared to the former version of the device, this one is simpler (only three parts) and will surely take less printing time but maybe it is a little less sturdy (taking advantage as it does of the flexible properties of plastic). It's probably also a bit more limited to umbrella's handle sizes. Compared to the first version, this one allows the umbrella's angle positioning with no toolsI came to this idea the other day watching a fellow getting soaked while he rolled his wheelchair wearing a cloak under the rain. I don't know if you can find somerthing alike in the shops, but he didn't have one and surely he would have found it really handy if he had had it then. So here it is, for the benefit of all of you that are less fortunate than me and cannot walk (but in any case, still like to get out when it is raining). The device is composed of three pieces of plastic (ABS or similar) to be printed. You will also need two countersunk head screws M5x20 (best would be DIN 10642) and two M5 nuts to fix it to the wheelchair. The device is designed to be attached to any wheelchair tube from 22 to 25 mm of diameter. The umbrella can be dettached with no tools. I haven't printed one myself (I haven't got a 3D printer) but I have doublechecked everything and it should assemble nicely (just as all my designs always do !!). Please let me know (gcon114@gmail.com) if you find any glitches in it or if you think it can be somehow improved, and I will gladly redesign it for you. So print it and enjoy the sunny side of the street !!

                Volksswitch - the People's AT Switch (Proof of Concept)
                			",Ken Hackbarth,"As I was working on a master’s degree in special education and a certificate in assistive technology, I had the opportunity to survey the domain of assistive technology – in particular electronic input devices. The first thing I noticed was a mind-numbing variety of available pressure switches with huge amounts of overlap in functionality and features. They’re also hugely expensive. It was difficult to understand why a particular manufacturer chose to incorporate a particular feature set into their switch, but once incorporated, there was little or no support for customization.While researching and writing my master's project, I happened to purchase a 3D Printer and immediately saw the opportunity that 3D printing created for low cost, one-off (personalized), manufacturing. The technology is also simple enough to use that it could be put into the hands of people close to the individuals with disabilities – OTs, PTs, ATPs, and even families.The switch design here is intended only as a proof of concept (POC) or as an existence proof. Every design element and decision could be improved upon and I hope it will. The purpose of this design is only to get the conversation started.The Volksswitch has goals in terms of cost, functionality and reliability but simultaneously aspires to high levels of customization and personalization – a capability which is only now feasible via the technology of 3D printing. If you believe, like I do, that’s possible, please visit the Volksswitch website (volksswitch.org) and join us!Power to the People! ---------------------------------------First Mechanical Remix... (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2870415)With this remix we removed the need for the heat-set threaded inserts to attach the cover and GoPro mount to the base. These components are expensive and take special equipment to insert them into the base and activation surface. We also replaced the 1/4 inch bolt with a printed post and a screw-in collar (with its own Teflon tube lining) to make the connection between the activation surface and the internal spring more stable and the action smoother.Download the files and then go to my website at: wp.me/P9evBA-4D to learn more about additional parts that are needed and how to assemble everything.

                Garden bench/swing coffee/beer table v2
                			",Adrian Siemieniak,"This is second version of my small bench table for tee/coffee or cookies :). Previouse design (observed after a year of usage) had at least few flaws. First of all, it was shaky - mouting point was too far away off the weight center. Secondly, beacuse printed plastics are not as rigid as mould ones, high temperature made holder/clamp soft and it usually lost the grip.Table is designed to be printable on standard 20x20cm print bed, without supports. Table size is 18x12cm and whole project is build from three components. Table itself, frame around and and three clamp/mount - you have to choose one. Clamp is designed for poles of approximately 50mm diameter. If yours are smaller - you can use some rubbers shims (or ask for another dimension :) )Second relase is much more stiff, works great and easily witholds high temperatures but all of this at a cost of mouting flexibility. Beacuse table fixing point is close to the center, it can't be mount on very vertical poles. Another thing, since clamp plastic was not strong enought to relay only on friction when fixing with table, now I've introduced 45deg angle, fixing positions. So you have to choose proper mount for your task.You will require also three m5 nuts, screws and washers - to fasten the clamp.  "

This here is my first attempt at putting together a prosthetic using only digital techniques. I felt this was an interesting study into the quickly changing world of manufacturing where many jobs are being automated or done digitally. The piece here was started using a skannect scan (photogrammetry), cleaned up and sculpted in Zbrush, then finally finished in Rhino and netfabb. I've cast the final piece out of silicone and given it a quick paint.While this is a witches nose, due to my lack of Zbrush expereince, the same process could be used to produce realistic limbs and skins for persons with injuries or missing limbs instead of makeup effects.The design can be easily split in netfabb to accomodate any print bed. To use the mold print both parts and clean up any stray plastic. Mix 60grams of silicone or another soft rubber, and pour into the mold portion. While the silicone is sill liquid, squash the nose scan (or the buck) into the cavity and the circular key.Apply pressure with a mold strap or light clamping until the silicone is cured.Once cured: Open to mold to find the nose fits the scanned person"

                Sixth-Finger / Sixth-Toe Capacitive Stylus
                			",Ken Hackbarth,"This design was inspired by a request posted to the ATMakers.org page on Facebook for a way to make a capacitive stylus that could be used by people with limited finger control. When I asked the poster to describe the device further I was pointed to a commercial device available on Amazon called the Sixth Digit by Handizap Capacitive Touchscreen Finger Stylus Ring (amazon.com/Handizap-Capacitive-Touchscreen-Finger-Stylus/dp/B016X2GMZK). I read through the comments of customers who had purchased the product and found that there were some fundamental issues with the design:• “Couldn't get them to stop rotating around my finger and you can't squeeze them to tight because it'll cut the circulation off in you pinky finger. Just the little bit I did use them I noticed that whatever the tip was made of it had already started to wear out pretty fast.”• “Worthless. They spin around your finger. At 2 for $30 I laughed at myself at how I got ripped off. Looks like something you would get out of a gumball machine. Don't waste your money.”• “Good idea but ring won't stay tight on finger”I chose a design that would mount to both the user’s little finger and ring finger to prevent the rotation and found some high quality capacitive tips (amazon.com/gp/product/B074XVH3JP/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) for about $0.60 apiece. I experimented with using a simple bolt as a conductor from the tip to the user’s finger as well as special conductive PLA from ProtoPasta (amazon.com/gp/product/B01BDL4BY0/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1). Both solutions work well and cost about the same - $1.00 to $1.50 per stylus, which is a savings of about $12 over the commercial product.The bolted stylus requires a 5 mm hex head bolt and two hex nuts. [The length of the bolt depends on the length of the desired stylus.] The conductive stylus requires only a single hex nut and the post can be arbitrarily long (or short).For greater customization, the post of the stylus is a separate component as is each of the rings so each component can be printed out of a different filament and each ring can have a different diameter to better fit the user’s fingers. I have included simple sizing rings that can be printed and tried before selecting a particular sized final ring to slice and print. I provide STL files for the posts in a variety of lengths and STL for the rings in a variety of internal diameters from 10 mm to 30 mm.Finally, I discovered that, by simply rotating the mounting point of certain ring types about 90 degrees, the same fundamental design could be used to attach the stylus to an individual’s foot. The larger diameter rings are particularly useful for that application.You can get detailed information about the process for selecting components and assembling each stylus by visiting our web page (wp.me/P9evBA-25).Note that everything you need for 3D printing is included in the ZIPX file. Ignore the STL files included on this page, They are just for illustration.Enjoy!Sixth Finger Stylus in action: youtu.be/vL_oSGm0IBwSixth Toe Stylus in action: youtu.be/TNfXjLh_SkwA very long stylus made of conductive filament: youtu.be/esuzNmWnNLg"

                The next beverage holder for people with disabilities
                			",Nils,"This is my next version of the beverage holder for people with disabilities. It is designed to be adjustable in height and inclination. You can put a glass, cup or can in it. If you put a little ribbon around it, it keeps neatly in place, even if someone hits the table it is standing on. With it wide legs it is almost tip-over-proof.The beverage holder consists of five parts: two screws, two legs and one plattform. Everything can be printed in about 5 hours. I hope you enjoy my design. Make sure to check the video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIda8vDgoi0) to see it in action.

                Self Aligning Cup/Bottle Holder
                			",Emanuel Garcês,"A self aligning cup/bottle holder for use with crutches, walkers and wheelchairs. Taking advantage of the gyroscopic effect and gravity this cup/bottle holder keeps its contents always aligned. Unfortunately many of the people that have limited use of their hands and fingers, have to simultaneously use crutches, walkers or wheelchairs and as such have trouble carrying bottles and cups, usually they depend on others to give them a helping hand. Some of them have attachments that allow them to carry these objects but most of the times these devices only allow for cans or closed bottles, for this reason I designed this gyroscopic cup holder, due to its design it will ensure that your drink is always correctly orientated and you can concentrate on moving to where you need to be.This design contains several versions of many parts to accommodate different placements, tube sizes cup/bottles sizes, it should be ideal for most uses but if you require a specific size for any of the parts (tube clip and clip supports) let me know and I will see what I can do for you.Printed with ABS at 280ºC, two perimeters (two perimeters are enough but for added strength I will print this again with three or four perimeters), 50mm/s, 3 solid top and bottom layers, 20% infill at 0.2mm layer height. Due to the tendency for warping ABS can be challenging therefore if it begins to warp, that warping can mess with the tolerances in this design, especially the holes for the screws, as such PLA or PET should be a better/easier print.Assembly:Begin by choosing what tube clip you need, standard or rotated, this will vary according to the place were it's going to be installed . The rotated indication refers to orientation of the hexagonal connector. Next you will need an 20mm M4 screw  and nut, for my build I used nylon locking ones but that is not required, next join the tube clip with the first ring (ring_1.stl)The second ring requires two 20mm M4 screws and nuts, simply slide the nuts on to the corresponding holes and using the screws attach the second ring (ring_2.stl) to the first (ring_1.stl), ensure that screw head rotates freely inside of it's space, if you have warping these holes might be too tight, either sand them until the screw rotates with no friction or reprint the part.There are two versions for the the last ring (ring_3.stl and ring_3_alt.stl), a solid one if you don't want/need the extra bottom part. Assemble it like the previous rings.If you chose to print ring_3.stl you have the possibility of adding clips and a bottom coaster to the cup holder. At this moment you need to choose one of sizes provided for the supports (S, M, L and XL). If you are unsure then the L version is probably the best compromise for an adult and the M the best for a child. Simply clip both parts (part1 and part2) to the third ring, it should just snap into place. Finally place the coaster at center, with the weight of a cup/bottle it will stay in place but you may need to add a few drops of glue to insure that it wont leave it's place. As a further improvement you can add a bit of cork to the coaster to better grip the drink.Check if all rings rotate almost friction less, if not sand them, reprint them or try to adding a bit of grease, if there's too much friction the cup holder won't be able to operate correctly.Every ring is attached using 20mm M4 screws  and nuts, except for the tube clip, this one will depend on the size of the tube or you can also use a good quality zip tie.Tip: Use a electrical insulating tape around the place were you are going to attach the tube clip, this will provide extra grip for the clip.Tip 2: Add a circle of cork to the bottom of the coaster to dive a better grip to the drinks."

                Pull saw for Maslow tabs
                			",Jon Turnquist,"I needed a pull saw to cut the tabs clean that my Maslow CNC generated and I wanted something more substantial than a hack saw blade. This uses any ""Sawzall"" type blade so you can use any length or type that fits that type of saw. The internal space fits the tang and saw profile for support so the thumb depression is ""up"" and the saw blade only fits that way. You may need to clean out the slot depending on how clean your printer prints. Be careful inserting the blade and be sure it's in far enough to secure the blade with the small bolt. I found tapping the handle base on the floor worked well to ""seat"" the blade. FYI: I designed the blade end profile first then just subtracted that (difference) from the body."

Once the inner has ran out of ink you can pull the pen apart and re-use it with another biro. I thought about selling this design but then thought better of it as i could see this helping people with dexterity problems and would rather give back to the community. Feedback on this first version of the pen greatly received.NOTE: The biro inner does need cutting down to length, whilst i have shown a photo of the dimension i used you may find it best to insert the biro into the end of the pen (and ensure it is pushed all the way in and the put the grip on the other end and the measure the gap left at the centre to ensure you get a accurate length for your print. I did find a couple inners did not work as the ink was to far up the shaft so i couldn't cut them short enough. Most did fit though."

                Baby Bottle Quick Warmer - Medela
                			",Drew Morgan,"This is a pair of drill-chuck adapters for Medela baby bottle lids: one for the older compact style, and one for the newer 'wavy' style. Spinning the bottle in hot water makes it warm up much faster than just letting it sit, and it also keeps the milk at a more uniform temperature, even in very hot water. It doesn't cause bubbles or froth.To use it, just clip your cold milk bottle into your 3/8"" variable speed drill and spin the bottle in a bowl or cup of hot water at moderate speed, 10 seconds on, 10 seconds off. The goal is to get as much difference as possible between the speed of the milk and the speed of the bottle. If you spin it too long at once, the milk will just spin up to the same speed as the bottle and you'll lose some efficiency.The models include baked-in supports for the shaft that can be easily removed with flush cutters or a hobby knife. They're optimized for a 0.4mm extrusion width."

This eliminates the need for you to always align the document in the frame of the camera app on your smart phone. I made this as an aide to people with arthritis. Holding a phone with good grip and scanning documents might be a challenge to those suffering from arthritis.Also, arthritis affected people might face difficulties holding a book for long periods while reading. In that case, you could put a book at the bottom and cast your smart phone onto a display like TV using chromecast or apple tv. There are four major parts manufactured separately through 3D printing and then assembled. 3D printing is powerful because, different phones have different camera view angles and sizes. Using the .stl files I uploaded, you can easily modify the components to be a good fit for your smart phone. I used FreeCAD to do this. It`s an open source CAD package which is very easy to use."

                			",Nils,"This little helper holds your scissor upright, so you can use it with only one hand. I designed it in three parts: the platform, a clamp, and a screw. As a special ed teacher, we use this with kids with cerebral palsy in the art class, for example. You can buy these as well, but they cost around 50€. As we need a lot of them in school, it is way cheaper to print them. Maybe you know someone who'll find this thing as useful as I do. Please check out my website as well: makershelpcare.deI made one video to explain it and one where I designed it both are in German and you'll find them below.

This Aid allows a better pressure distribution.There are two prototypes. One ""Leg support.stl"" can be attached by pressure to the frame of the wheel chair. The other one """"Leg support with velcro.stl"" is an alternative in case that the first one broke when it's attached to the weelchair (due to weak layer union).

                Arduino driven Hand Actuator
                			",Jose Santos Lizcano,"When I saw what eNABLE does and started reading the problems eNABLE community members face when designing, printing and assembling the prosthetic hands in any variant, I was able to identify a couple of problems that were common to almost all cases, and I decided to start working on a way to try and solve those the best i could.So I first identified the scale/size problem; when a printed hand involves screws or bolts and other standard-sized hardware, it becomes very problematic to properly scale to a recipients custom size.Then it comes the mechanic part of it; all systems I have seen, use the force the recipient has in his/her forearm/wrist to open/close it. (V/O, V/C) This has a lot of disadvantages since every recipient is different and a design that may seem to work for some, may not for work for others, (different flexion and extension) and the strength exerted by it varies accordingly, but always inside certain values (never too strong) dictated by the forearm/wrist itself.We encounter limit in the 3dprinters, too, that cannot accurately print smaller features and also, the plastic itself reaches a limit in its mechanical properties as features get smaller. Also regarding scale/size, there´s the thing about trans radial amputation, where the above (wrist actuated) does not apply.Besides, the thing about the individual fingers controlled all at once seems very disadvantageous, since, in the most cases all fingers share a common pivot point, which in turn makes grasping non-cylindrical objects, very difficult, if not impossible.So I started working on these topics and designed this pieces I present you here.I designed an enclosure where the mechanical side of things happen, that doesn’t need scaling, and that can interact with any type of 3dprinted hand (PTC), eliminating the problems with varying hardware sizes.Also, I designed a pulley system that multiplies the work that the actuating servo can produce, along with a second pulley system that allows the fingers to move somewhat independently, giving them more freedom to grasp conical objects or other non-cylindrical ones. This enclosure can be axially (collinear) mounted on the recipient´s residual limb, if there´s enough room for it between the elbow and the wrist, or it can be mounted on the underside of the residual limb, via a couple adapters. (This part is still in progress, but the current version works pretty much ok, I think).Everything was designed to be 3dprinted without any support, making it easier for anyone to assemble it without much knowledge/skill required.Also I tried to remove as much material as possible so it could be as light but as strong as possible.All 3dprinted parts weigh at 178 gr.The heaviest parts are the battery and the linear servo that controls the movement.The movement is actuated via an Arduino Micro microcontroller that reads the values from a Myoware sensor placed on the biceps muscle group. The Arduino actuates the servo, that moves the fingers via a multiplying pulley and a tensor system that allows independent motion between the fingers.There´s an Arduino sketch (code/program) I wrote, that calibrates the sensor each time the system is turned on, so if the readings from the Myoware sensor vary depending on its placement on the recipient´s arm, the system adapts to this.Hardest part of this system while assembling it, is that it requires soldering, and that´s it, pretty simple.I tried to make it as simple, light, efficient, cheap and strong as possible.I am using red PLA, printed at 195c, with .3mm layers, and varying percentages of infill, all printed on a Makerbot Replicator 2, using a Flexy-Hand (by Gyrobot) to demonstrate the working principles of my design. Clearly, this design can and will work with any PTD design that actuates (V/O, V/C) via pulling strings (tendons).You will find the complete list of materials with its recommended print settings and characteristics in the files attached, as well as the Arduino code involved and instructions for assembly.Even when the challenge is for a PTD with several technical requirements, and my design doesn’t fully comply with all of them, I think it´s a great time and opportunity to share this work that I believe can be very helpful (mainly in concept but also in execution).I really hope it’s something that contributes to the eNABLE community.Thanks for reading, and again, please feel free to comment/ask me on this design.José Santos Lizcano."

                Nail Clipper Holder
                			",Jacob Jarvis,This is a nail clipper holder made to assist those aflicted with arthritis modified from an original design found here: https://www.makersmakingchange.com/project/nail-clipper-holder/The original design relies heavily on a flexible plastic being used to print the holder as well al a separate set of nuts and bolts. This revised eddition eliminates the use of extra materials using snap fits for the seprate components. It also incorperates a hinge to allow for more rigid plastics to be used for fabrication.Nail clipper holders and other easy-grip items can be found on the market for as much as $6 a unit (Amazon) but this aid can be printed with as little as 60 grams of material at $20/kg (PLA) which is a unit price of about $1.20 without the wait for shipping.

                3D printed orthotic swimming fin

In August 2012 he suffered a stroke, a left ganglion basal hemorrhage, which paralysed half part of his body. After a long period of rehabilitation, Pedro recovered a great part of the mobility, except in his right hand, affected by spasticity. Spasticity is a disorder of the central nervous system that causes an increase of the muscular tone hindering totally or partially the movement of the affected muscles.By using the BCN3D Sigma 3D printer, industrial designers created a customized orthotic swimming fin enterly designed for anthropometric measures of Pedro's hand.BCN3D Sigma 3D printer: bcn3dtechnologies.com/3d-printer/bcn3d-sigmaThanks to the immediacy that 3D printing offers, Pedro had his personalized 3D printed swimming fin in a very short period, generating, among others, the following advantages:Improvement in body position, facilitating stroke and movement.An increase of the musculature in the upper part of the body.Due to the improvement in the swimming position, Pedro spent more time in the pool without getting tired.

That's a great thing they've been doing. There's also a ""Snap-Together Robohand"" version, thing 92937, which is intended to be easier to build. I'm sure it is... but it still takes half a day to print the parts and assemble them. Unfortunately, I had less than 3 hours total on Saturday, September 28, 2013, to give an overview of making technologies and have YMCA Black Achievers students actually build something.So, I designed a new prosthetic/robotic hand for which all the printed parts print assembled without supports in less than an hour. You still have to thread some fishing line and rubber bands through it, but from print start to working hand is easily done in less than 90 minutes using a total of about $1 worth of materials!"

Has a hole on the bottom big enough for a finger to push the coins up from the bottom if there isn't enough coins left to just take it from the top, but small enough that quarters won't fall out. [currently designing v.2. where the hole is not needed where there is a little slider that goes up and down]-Screw on capA simple lid with a slit on the top so you don't have to unscrew the cap every time the cashier gives you one or two quarters to put them in. It's small enough that it is very unlikely for any quarters to fall out when shaken.-Travel RingI put this in there so that I can attach the ring to the top of the inside of my book bag so that it is easy to reach, and easy to take out of the ring, just slide it in or out. You can also attach a small piece of cord or string to it and attach it to your belt.I printed mine with 100 Microns with PLA with my Da Vinci Jr. 1.0 with 10% infill.If there any suggestions or problems you come across while using it, I'd appreciate it and I'd include a fix for it in v.2.Henryqiu19@gmail.com for any questions.I can print out one for you at https://www.3dhubs.com/user/120043/dashboard/hub if you don't own a 3D printerHappy Spending!BackstoryI'm 14 and I travel to and from school 40 miles every day, and every day I buy pizza and some snacks before and after school. I'm a fan of using quarters to purchase items less than $5 at once. Pizza would cost $2.75 and I would reach into my bag and count out 11 quarters. This has been a hassle, searching for coins. I tried ziplock bags, pill bottles, but none were sturdy enough so I was on TinkerCAD and uploaded a simple cylinder... when an idea popped into my head."

                Umbrella Holder for wheelchair - Version2 Revised
                			",CARLOS BASAURI,"Umbrella holder for wheelchair   I came to this idea the other day watching a fellow getting soaked while he rolled his wheelchair wearing a cloak under the rain. I don't know if you can find somerthing alike in the shops, but he didn't have one and surely he would have found it really handy if he had had it then. So here it is, for the benefit of all of you that are less fortunate than me and cannot walk (but in any case, still like to get out when it is raining).   The device is composed of five pieces of plastic (ABS or similar) to be printed. You will also need one broached head cap screw M8 x 70 mm and a M8 nut to fix it to the wheelchair.   The device is designed to be attached to any wheelchair tube from 22 to 25 mm of diameter, and it should hold any umbrella with a handle diameter 14 to 28 mm. The umbrella can be dettached with no tools.   I haven't printed one myself (I haven't got a 3D printer) but I hope everything assembles nicely . Please let me know (gcon114@gmail.com) if you find any glitches in it or if you think it can be somehow improved, and I will gladly redesign it for you.   So just print it and enjoy the sunny side of the street !! (even if it is raining) So if you like the thing and you are not getting wet anymore, why don't you tip me? I'll really appreciateSpecial thanks to Vaclav Krmela who helped me improve the design and test printed it !!"

                Flip Flops (Jandals / Thongs / Sandals) Stand
                			",Muzz64,This simple little stand organizes your Flip Flops (Jandals / Thongs / Sandals) to keep them tidy and save space by making them stand upright. Once mounted the stand can also be hung up on a hook if required and the Flip Flops will stay secure and held in place... no more messy Flip Flops lying around or taking up more floor space than is necessary.The stand is easy to use... just slide your Flip Flops into the slots heel down with the soles facing each other. This puts a small amount of pressure between them so they stand upright and stay in place in the stand.Five versions are provided for different thickness heels ranging from 15mm to 35mm. This should cover most thickness of Flip Flops. Determining the size to print is easy... just measure the thickness of the heel of your Flip Flops and print the size required.For example:With a heel thickness of 20mm use the 20mm file and you should have a snug / slight compression when the Flip Flops are inserted into the slots. There will also be tension between the soles that holds the Flip Flops in and secure.With a heel thickness of 22mm go up to the 25mm file. The heels will be slightly loose in the slots but there will be tension between the soles so the Flip Flops will still be securely held in the stand.This is an easy-to-use practical and space-saving solution. Print in your colour of choice and color code for different people or pair of Flip Flops so they know the correct stand for the pair concerned. Handy to use yourself but also great as a small gift.The stands are all quite small so don't take long to print or use much filament. Please post images of your stands in use for others to see.Please refer to the print settings / instructions and the images for additional information.Note: If you like this check out the rest of my practical and fun designs.

It also makes the buttons much larger and brings the scroll wheel towards the user without sacrificing the middle click function. The power switch and battery cover are still accessible below the mouse for easy maintenance.Hardware recommended: (lengths are just what I used - the design allows for some wiggle-room):6 x 1/4"" 4-402 x 3/8"" 4-401 x 1/2"" 4-40Assembly:After printing all pieces, put the mouse into the Base so it sits firmly against the front. Push the Mouse Brace against it, and secure with two 1/4"" 4-40 screws. The mouse may wiggle a little bit but should be held firmly when placed on a flat surface. Next, install the Wheel into the Wheel Brace with one 3/8"" 4-40 screw on each side. The wheel should spin freely but not wobble side to side. Use super glue or threadlocker to ensure it doesn't come out after repeated spinning and pressing. Attach the Wheel/Brace assembly to the Base with a 1/2"" 4-40 screw. This screw should be snug, but loose enough that the Wheel can be pressed down to do a middle click (it can be adjusted later.) Last, put on both Clicker Plates and secure with four more 1/4"" 4-40 screws."

                Customizable, 3D Printable AAC Keyguard for Tablets
                			",Ken Hackbarth,"Keyguards help individuals with limited ability to point reliably at regions of an app running on a tablet. They do this by physically separating access to specific regions of the tablet screen with rails that rise up from the surface of the tablet. In this case, the apps are associated with Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC).Some AAC apps organize their content into grids with menus and message bars, above or below the grid. Others are much more creative and unpredictable in their layouts. Hybrid apps are largely grid-based but their keyguards can be enhanced by selectively exposing specific regions of the app.The number of possible choices for tablet, tablet case, and AAC app, make it impossible to design a few keyguards that will meet everyone's needs. To complicate matters further, users have lots of flexibility for how they organize the content in their apps. All of this is to say that users must be given control over the keyguard design. I know of only one 3D modeling tool where that is possible - without requiring that each user become an expert in 3D modeling. That tool is OpenSCAD. OpenSCAD has a ""Customizer"" feature that allows users to provide input to an OpenSCAD design that can shape the design to meet their specific needs.We have created an OpenSCAD design that allows the user to identify their tablet, describe how the AAC app is laid out, describe their case, and choose a mounting method to mount the keyguard directly to the tablet or to the case. Once the keyguard is fully described you can generate and save an STL file that you can print on your 3D printer.This is a Thingiverse Customizer design but only for grid-based apps. Free-form and Hybrid apps require greater specification and visualization than Thingiverse's Customizer can support. For those keyguards you will need to download and install the latest version of OpenSCAD and a good text editor like Notepad++.If you will be using OpenSCAD, the only files you need to download from here are called keyguard.scad and data.scad. All other files are just for illustration. You also need to go to wp.me/P9evBA-5b to learn how to customize the keyguard.UPDATE 22 Jun 2018 (version 9): Combined functionality for both grid-based and free-form keyguards into a single designer. Added support rounding the corners of the keyguards, when they are placed in a case, to accommodate cases that have rounded corners on their openings. Can now create cell openings that are rounded-rectangles. Can limit the borders of a keyguard to the size of the screen for testing layouts.UPDATE 12 Jun 2018 (version 8): Reduced the maximum slide-in tab width from 30 mm to 10 mm. Added the ability to merge circular cells horizontally and to merge both rectangular and circular cells verticallyUPDATE 25 May 2018 (version 7): Padding options have been moved to the Grid Layout section of the user interface to clarify that these affect only the grid region of the screen. Changed the width of the right border of the iPad 5th generation tablet to match width of the left border. Made some variable value changes so that it is easier to see the choices selected in the Thingiverse Customizer. Changed cover_home_button and cover_camera to display_home_button and display_camera because the original options were confusing.UPDATE 20 May 2018 (version 6): Added support for controlling the slope of top or bottom edges of message and command bars.UPDATE 8 May 2018 (version 5): You can print out a plug for one of the cells in the keyguard by choosing ""cell cover"" in the Tablet>generate pull-down. You can add a fudge factor to the height and width of the tablet to accommodate filaments that shrink slightly when printing. You can add add padding around the screen to make the keyguard stronger without affecting the grid and bars to account for cases that go right up to the edge of the screenUPDATE 27 Apr 2018 (version 4): I've added a new version of the OpenSCAD file - keyguard v4.scad It provides support for circular cut-outs and puts an option to specify the shape of the cut-outs in the Customizer UI. At the same time, I've added support for covering one or more cells and support for merging a cell cut-out and the next cell cut-out.UPDATE 25 Apr 2018 (version 3): I've added a new version of the OpenSCAD file - keyguard v3.scad. It has been rewritten to better support portrait mode and to use cuts to create openings to the screen surface rather than defining rails. This opens the door for openings with other geometries in the future - like circles and ovals. We fixed a bug in where padding appeared - put it around the grid rather than around the screen. We increased the depth of Velcro cut-outs to 3 mm, which roughly translates to 2 mm when printed. The cut for the home button is now made at 90 deg. to not encroach on the grid on tablets with narrow borders.UPDATE 22 Apr 2018 (version 2): I've added a new version of the OpenSCAD file - keyguard v2.scad. It contains all the functionality of the original file and adds support for a new mounting method: ""Clip-on Straps"". As always, the website above is where you go to see how everything comes together.i3 MK3 Rafts:No Supports:No Resolution:1.5 mm Infill:20% Notes:You generally don't need supports except when printing a keyguard with raised tabs.Post-PrintingThe edges on the keyguard can feel a bit sharp. Go to wp.me/P9evBA-5b to see examples of how to soften these edges.How I Designed ThisDesigned entirely in OpenSCAD. keyguard.scad can be edited with any text editor to extend its capabilities.

                Loc Line Switch
                			",Jon Turnquist,"Summary: I needed a wheelchair mounted, elbow activated switch for a client with very limited movement. Here is a locline mounted switch that uses a 1.5 inch push button switch from Banggood. (45mm Arcade Video Game Big Round Push Button LED Lighted Illuminated Lamp @ $2.21 ). I needed all the wires internal inside the locline and this uses a 3/4"" npt connection to the loc-line. Has two parts that just press fit together. This switch has a LED light but I'm not using it. I had to bend the switch connector tabs a bit to clear but no big deal. Wire COM and N.O. (normally open) connectors for the switch. This is much lighter than the jelly bean switch mount so much less sagging with the loc-line.Link for switch: https://www.banggood.com/45mm-Arcade-Video-Game-Big-Round-Push-Button-LED-Lighted-Illuminated-Lamp-p-1044297.html?rmmds=detail-left-hotproducts__4&cur_warehouse=CN  "

The leads for this are even rarer than the console so here's a compatible connector, the pin-out is on our website at re-enthused.com.To use it you just need to get some pins, solder the wires on then push them through the right holes. I recommend hot-gluing the pins in from the inside.This should be fairly easy to print, but some printers may have trouble with the small holes on the pin header."

                3D printed wheelchair. I call it the HU-GO
                			",Hugo-archicad,"I decided to create this wheelchair because I have used one before due to my own illness,I was a Sydney 2000 Olympic volunteer and part of my job then was to help people that are a different kind of perfect move around the Olympic park.we even received training how to operate a wheelchair during the induction.I have been 3D printing many things and for many people over the last 3 years and I think is time I begin to design/make something for a noble cause.So, I thought I should pay it forward and create one that anyone in the world could make and assemble with a very common cheap parts.I visited my country of Birth Chile a few months ago and I saw first hand how 3D printed parts for different kind of perfect people could transform their lives but sadly they didnt know where to go to get their needs met or that it could be very cheap.I strongly Believe that everyone in the world deserves to be able to move about and a wheelchair should not be a luxury item for the few/well off.It should be a tool that anyone should have access to use.I would love for a school to take this up and make it into a formal design project.I see this project divided into 4 phases.Drawing/DesignWoodworkTextiles3D printingTextiles:The sawing of the cushions and armrests plus the support of these onto the wheelchair itselfWoodwork:The frame, cutting the MDF from a template, sanding, painting, drilling holesLearning how to measure, cut holes with drill, use of jigsaw.3D printingPrinting the bits and checking for tolerances. This is a lovely thing a friend does for a mate but it should not have to be this hard!!http://laughingsquid.com/chinese-student-piggybacks-his-disabled-friend-to-class-for-three-years-so-he-wouldnt-miss-out-on-his-education/The material list will be like this: (will be adding more as I need it)-Plywood/MDF 16mm thick-roll of plastic (1 kilo exactly is what will be needed to print all the components!!)at the end I will rename each part so it has its weight in grams in case you are wondering if you have enough.-zip ties (to support not load bearing components instead of using nuts, bolts and washers which are heavier and more expensive ( I used these for the seat support beam ends)-rods 'broom sticks' of two sizes (50mm for cross bracing and 20mm for the others)-nuts and bolts (will specify how many, what type, size, lenght,etc)-paint (because the frame is kind of chunky a nice vibrant happy colour would be great (I will do version 1 in red because it will go faster)-2 old/new long 'socks' for the arm restsfabric for the seats (I was thinking flour bags) and or old tshitstools required-Jigsaw-drill (hand held or electric)-screwdriver-spanner (will specify size)-access to a 3D printer-access to needle and thread-pair of scissorsand a bit of room to make it. (I live in a small apartment so my workshop was my balcony which I had to leave everytime my little dog needed to go to the toilet, he is shy and doesn't like to go when there are people watching), so a little more room would be best and a bench/table would be great to have too.finally, I dont like the term disabled so instead I replace it with ""a different kind of perfect"" which I got from here (its far nicer)http://themighty.com/2015/04/the-term-that-describes-my-daughter-better-than-special-needs-or-disabled/note: I have started to put PDF's now.once I do the frame today, I will make a cad file of it in PDF and DWG and STL in one piece so that maybe someone with a laser cutter machine big enough can cut it automatically.also when the frame is done i will assemble it and begin to take photos of the real thing!!!!This project has taken a great amount of time, effort and resources to design and build.(As you know any prototype is expensive at first, I am happy to wear the costs)My purpose is to share it with the world for free, however a small contribution would be a huge help to continue its development.please go here and help me if you believe in this worthy cause.https://www.paypal.me/justonedollarMy dream would be for this project to be copied by someone like IKEA and mass produce this flat packed and shipped wherever these might be needed as part of help that countries offer one another.Anyone with questions or help, done hesitate to send me a message and I will endeavour to reply ASAP.Also if anyone would like to donate a 3D printer for this cause don't hesitate to get in touch with me.It doesn't even need to be big or fancy, i can modify the wheelchair parts to fit their built area. you would be doing a great thing."

                telescopic distance grabber
                			",Aaron Lutin-Smet,Why is this not only a cool toy but also a very useful tool to improve the quality of live ? In Belgium the amount of people above 65 is rising  and with it the amount of people who have back problems. The biggest issue for people with back problems is  bending there back. It is not only useful for these people but also for disabled people in wheelchairs. They can take it everywhere with them because its small when undeployed. That’s why the telescopic distance grabber will improve their live. The telescopic distance grabber I designed is far more practical then al the original ones you can buy in the shop. It was a real challenge to make it telescopic. It had to be strong but not too big. So I ordered several 3d prints to test the design on strength  and practicality. The second challenge was making sure it could be 3d printed. I made sure the walls where a factor of 0.4mm so there are no gabs in the wall when printed. After a month of tests and redesigning the product was finished at my satisfaction.When its deployed it measures 108 cm (42.5 inch) . If its undeployed it measures 37 cm (14.5 inch).  When printing this I recommend to not scale it more than 75 percent because the walls will become thinner and there for weaker. It’s also better to use ABS then PLA. When u print it in ABS use a raft. With a raft it should print fine depending on the printer you have.

                Wheelchair-Mounted Dog Treat Dispenser
                			",Tikkum Olam Makers,"About the project: This project provides wheelchair users with limited dexterity a device to train and reward their service dogs easily and conveniently.The Problem:This project was undertaken in cooperation with PADS (Pacific Assistance Dog Society), a non-profit organization in Vancouver, BC that breeds, raises, trains and supports certified assistance dogs, partnering them with people living with disabilities. Assistance dogs at PADS and many other organizations are trained using the clicker method. Good behaviors and successful commands are marked with a distinctive noise from a handheld clicker, followed by a dog treat. Many wheelchair users who are provided with service dogs find it difficult to use a clicker and deliver treats due to reduced mobility or dexterity. There is a need for an easy-to-use wheelchair-mounted device that can make a clicking noise and dispense treats. Currently, all available products are either unsuitable for this task, or prohibitively expensive.The Solution:A 3D-printable device was designed to simultaneously deliver treats and actuate a typical handheld clicker using a simple pushing motion. It can be mounted on the side of a wheelchair using a commonly-available type of mounting bar and bracket. The device is made of exclusively 3D printed parts in order to eliminate any potential difficulties sourcing components, and does not require any electronics. It is both easy and affordable to replicate.

                Shoelace tie helper
                			",Edison Siu,"Most common everyday practical shoes have laces on them. However, tying them is a nearly impossible task for someone with limited mobility in their hands. This  device simplifies the process of tying shoes by incorporating a screwing method. The device allows you to insert your shoelaces in and screw in the bolt to tie your shoes by inserting the lace into the hole of the large ring attached to the bolt sleeve, and then loop it over and placing the aglet (plastic tip commonly found on the end of shoelaces) onto the top of the bolt into the holes, you can then screw the bolt in and have the shoes tied. The design is meant to be small in order to not draw too much attention when on the shoe. The design incorporates bumps on the bolt to aid with grip, and has a small compact design. This device can help people with limited mobility in their hands by simplifying the process of tying shoes which is pretty much an everyday task most people have to overcome. The device is intentionally designed to be a screw with a rigid bolt in order to increase grip, and to allow for one-handed tying. Many of today's shoes have laces, and although there are alternatives such as slip in shoes, they are not as common to find, can tend to be much more expensive, and are not as practical, comfortable, or durable compared to shoes, such as sneakers, which have laces to conform closely to the user's foot. The only other comparable alternative is Velcro, but Velcro can be a hassle especially if dirt or other substances get in them and takes a long time to clean afterwards and make them unusable when substances get into them. Laces however, are small, thin, and compact making it the best in shoe tying and are completely reliable to be functional even after years of wear. Additionally, the shoe market for most comfortable and common everyday shoes is almost entirely revolving around shoes with laces, because laces are the cheapest and easiest method to adjust shoes and are easy to produce for the shoe companies. This product will open up that market for those with limited mobility in their hands, and will allow for a broader market of shoes for those with limited mobility in their hands. This device is compatible for almost any disability concerning the arm and hand. This device can be worked with, for example, by people who cannot fully close their hands by using their palms to screw in the laces, by those who cannot open their hands entirely, by either using their hands or wrists to screw it in, by people who are only able to utilize one arm,  to use the device one handed, and many more possibilities. Additionally, thanks, to Aubenc for the original thingiverse bolt design which was inspiration to my design."

                Parametric Playing Cards with Optional Braille Dots
                			",Riskable,"Have you got an SLS 3D Printer (or a ton of patience)?  Then you can 3D print your own customized deck of playing cards!An example deck is included (without braille because MMF wouldn't allow me to upload a file > 75MB) but you can use OpenSCAD to make your own using whatever fonts or designs you want.  If you generate a deck of cards with braille the dots will be in the lower-left corner because it's more ergonomic!  Why normal braille playing cards don't put the dots there is beyond me (who wants to reach up all the way to the top or awkardly hold the cards in an upside down V--reaching to the bottom right to read the braille upside down?).Inside the .scad is a number of parameters that can be modified to make your deck of cards however you like but there's two settings you *really* need to pay attention to: card_thickness and space_between_cards.If you go below 0.3mm card thickness there's a chance your opponent could see your suit/rank through the card.  This is highly dependent on the type of material you used to print the cards.The 'space_between_cards' setting should be set according to your printer's tolerances.  After doing much research I've determined that about 0.5mm should be well within the tolerances of the SinterIt Lisa.  Since I don't have a Lisa to print with I cannot confirm this but you should actually be able to print multiple decks at once!If you don't have an SLS printer then you're stuck printing each card, one at a time.  This is definitely possible you'll just have to be patient and generate each card you want to print using the OpenSCAD .scad file individually.  I recommend printing one at a time in the exact same place on your print bed so there's no variance in the front of the card.  Unless of course you're printing onto glass or something that is perfectly flat across its entire surface.NOTE: It can take a long time to render a complete deck of cards.  It took my modern/fast computer about an hour (I was doing other things in the background though).  The preview (F5) is nice and fast though!There's lines in the .scad that are commented out that serve as examples of how to view individual cards (say, Ace of Spades).  So designing your own should be quick and easy."

Eventually I will print in ABS.These parts are still being proven and Im making constant changes. So put a watch on it, or check back over time.2 versions of the handles... one for a rounded pedal and one for a square one. I will be uploading a generic one too (although the square one is pretty generic).Assembly/Use:If you have finger mobility you may not need the collar and extender, and can just grip the handle. If you need wrist support, then also use the Collar to allow for 'pull' grip while cycling.You may need to wrap some tape or cushioning around the collar and even the handle.The parts can be glued/screwed together once the correct config is found. For this purpose you may need to drill additional holes in the parts in the exact spot it must be fixed.Pictures attached of a right-hand assembly including the collar. The collar must be scaled such that the wrist can fit into the gap horizontally, but cant slip out once the arm is 'upright'. Some scaling/cutting/sanding may be required...If you already have a handcycle with para-grips, you can still use the collar and extender to add wrist-support as long as the extender can be fixed to the bottom of the grips that are on your bike.Note that getting this right is not just a print and go... you will have to try a few things, scale the models. You may also require to cut/tinker with the pedals to get them working."
